    Carol Dweck and Derek Muller have two differing teaching styles. Both are experts on education, and how people can learn the most successfully. Carol’s video is a more hand off, or behind the scenes, approach to learning styles. She explains studies conducted on students, supports herself using graphs and brain scans, and shows ways that her methods have been successfully introduced to students. Derek Muller uses a more hands on approach by interacting with everyday people in order to engage viewers on YouTube to learn more about a specific field that he is trying to teach. His videos force people to be vulnerable by attempting to answer questions they may not know much about. He points out that people aren’t stupid for not knowing about the specific questions, they are just unknowledgeable about them. This is where the two educator’s styles overlap.

    Muller implements Dweck’s growth mind idea by allowing people to make mistakes and then learn from them. He really aligns with the third rule of the growth mindset module: “capitalize on mistakes and confront deficiencies.” He allows takes these often huge mistakes and makes a learning opportunity out of them. In a way, Muller is putting into practice Dweck’s research by forcing his participants to utilize a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset. These interviews are raw, and certainly do not allow for people to “hide [their] mistakes or deficiencies.”
